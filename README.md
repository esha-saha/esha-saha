- 👋 Hi, I’m @esha-saha
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring mathematics of machine learning algorithms and how to improve their efficiency and accuracy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about diffusion models, stability analysis of neural network models and machine learning algorithms for dynamical systems.
- 🎓 I'm currently looking for post-doc positions or research positions in applied mathematics (machine learning based applications). My expected PhD graduation is by December 2023. I would also be up for short term internships in Summer 2023.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mathematical analysis of neural network based models such as diffusion models, GANs, VAEs, etc.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out at esaha@uwaterloo.ca

- 👋 Hi, I’m @esha-saha
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring mathematics of machine learning algorithms and how to improve their efficiency and accuracy in data sparse applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on modeling wildfire risks and spread using machine learning and PDE/dynamical systems.
- 🎓 I'm currently a Grant Notley Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Alberta.
- ✍️ I am looking for permanent positions and open to research positions in both academia and/or industry.
- 💞️ I work on scientific machine learning modeling of various environmental phenomena such as monitoring emissions, wildfire risk mapping, etc.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out at esaha1@ualberta.ca
